2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-2#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock source pin  
A primary clock TopBlockDesign_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate pin TopBlockDesign_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1. It is recommended to create a primary clock only on a proper clock source (input port or primitive output pin with no timing arc)
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock TopBlockDesign_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_fpga_1 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_out1_TopBlockDesign_clk_wiz_0_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_TopBlockDesign_clk_wiz_0_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_out1_TopBlockDesign_clk_wiz_0_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_TopBlockDesign_clk_wiz_0_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on DAC_Mode relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on DAC_Sleep relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on gpio_rtl_tri_o[0] relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on gpio_rtl_tri_o[1] relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on gpio_rtl_tri_o[2] relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#6 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on gpio_rtl_tri_o[3] relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#7 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on gpio_rtl_tri_o[4] relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#8 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on gpio_rtl_tri_o[5] relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#9 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on gpio_rtl_tri_o[6] relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#10 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on gpio_rtl_tri_o[7] relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0
Related violations: <none>
